# Introduction to Incident Response

## Types of Security Incidents

### Critical Incidents
```plaintext
1. Data Breaches
   - PII/PHI exposure
   - Credit card data compromise
   - Intellectual property theft

2. Ransomware Attacks
   - File encryption
   - System lockout
   - Ransom demands

3. Advanced Persistent Threats
   - Long-term infiltration
   - Data exfiltration
   - Command & control activity
```

## Security Incident Response Team (SIRT)

### Core Team Members
```plaintext
1. Incident Response Manager
   - Coordinates response efforts
   - Makes critical decisions
   - Reports to executives

2. Security Analysts
   - Monitors alerts
   - Investigates incidents
   - Performs initial triage

3. Forensics Specialists
   - Collects evidence
   - Performs detailed analysis
   - Documents findings

4. System Administrators
   - Implements changes
   - Maintains systems
   - Assists with recovery
```

## Incident Response Plan

### Plan Components
```plaintext
1. Preparation
   - Tools readiness
   - Team training
   - Documentation

2. Identification
   - Alert monitoring
   - Initial assessment
   - Severity classification

3. Containment
   - Isolate affected systems
   - Block malicious activity
   - Preserve evidence

4. Eradication
   - Remove threat
   - Patch vulnerabilities
   - Verify removal

5. Recovery
   - Restore systems
   - Verify functionality
   - Monitor for reoccurrence

6. Lessons Learned
   - Document incident
   - Update procedures
   - Improve detection
```

## Malware Analysis with ANY.RUN

### Sample Analysis Steps
```plaintext
1. Initial Setup
   - Create ANY.RUN account
   - Select analysis environment
   - Configure monitoring options

2. Ransomware Analysis
   - Upload sample safely
   - Monitor file changes
   - Network connections
   - Registry modifications

3. Analysis Examples
   Sample: Wannacry Ransomware
   - File encryption patterns
   - C2 communication attempts
   - Persistence mechanisms
```

## Example Incident Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Ransomware Attack
```plaintext
Initial Alert:
- Multiple file encryption alerts
- Users report locked systems
- Ransom notes appearing

SIRT Response:
1. IR Manager: Activates incident response plan
2. Security Analysts: Identify patient zero
3. System Admins: Isolate affected networks
4. Forensics: Collect ransomware samples
```

### Scenario 2: Data Breach
```plaintext
Initial Alert:
- Unusual data transfers
- Off-hours access
- Large file downloads

SIRT Response:
1. IR Manager: Notifies legal team
2. Security Analysts: Track data movement
3. Forensics: Review access logs
4. System Admins: Block external transfers
```

## Best Practices

### Documentation
```markdown
1. Incident Logging
   - Time/date stamps
   - Actions taken
   - Team members involved
   - Evidence collected

2. Communication
   - Team updates
   - Management briefings
   - Stakeholder notifications
```

### Tool Preparation
```markdown
1. Analysis Tools
   - ANY.RUN account ready
   - Forensics software updated
   - Network monitors configured

2. Response Tools
   - Backup solutions
   - Isolation procedures
   - Recovery systems
```
