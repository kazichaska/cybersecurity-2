## 🔍 Case Summary: PGCU Financial Discrepancy Investigation

### 🎯 **Objective:**

Investigate whether Peter Barnes, Rosie Lloyd, or any other employee at the Dallas branch of PGCU is responsible for the unexplained loss of nearly **\$100,000** over 6 months, using **digital forensic techniques** on the confiscated **iPhone images**.

---

## 📌 Investigation Steps

### 1. **Establish a Chain of Custody**

Ensure both iPhone images (Peter & Rosie) are:

* Properly imaged (e.g., using Cellebrite, Magnet AXIOM, or similar).
* Labeled with timestamps, hashes (MD5/SHA256), and stored securely.

### 2. **Mobile Forensics Analysis**

Use forensic tools to extract and analyze:

#### a. **Messages & Communication Apps**

* **iMessage, SMS, WhatsApp, Signal, Telegram** (look for code names, e.g., “X”)
* Search keywords: "cash", "deposit", "get back", "PGCU", “X”, “audit”, “split”, “Evelyn”, “suspension”, etc.

#### b. **Photos & Media**

* Search for images of money, deposit receipts, or screenshots of financial apps
* Extract EXIF data (timestamps, GPS metadata)

#### c. **Browser & App History**

* Check for banking apps, secure notes, encrypted communication, or hidden vaults

#### d. **Call Logs**

* Look for frequent communication between Peter and Rosie
* Unusual or anonymized numbers

#### e. **Location History**

* Verify presence at the bank on days of highest cash discrepancy
* Cross-reference GPS with known locations of cash pickups/deposits

## 🧠 Hypothesis Development

### Working Theories:

* Peter acted alone and planned the theft while working as lead teller.
* Rosie and Peter colluded (e.g., she advised him on laundering or hiding transactions).
* A third party ("X") is involved (possibly an insider or external actor).
