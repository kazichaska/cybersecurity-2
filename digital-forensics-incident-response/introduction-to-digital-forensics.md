# Introduction to Digital Forensics

## Overview
Digital forensics is the process of collecting, preserving, analyzing, and reporting digital evidence in a legally admissible way. This guide covers core principles, methodologies, and practical applications.

## Basic Principles

### Core Fundamentals
```plaintext
1. Chain of Custody
   - Document who handled evidence
   - When it was handled
   - Where it was stored
   - How it was transferred

2. Data Integrity
   - Create forensic images
   - Verify hash values
   - Use write blockers
   - Maintain documentation
```

### Methodologies
```plaintext
1. Evidence Collection
   - Secure the scene
   - Document everything
   - Photograph evidence
   - Use proper tools

2. Analysis Process
   - Create working copies
   - Use forensic workstation
   - Document findings
   - Maintain timeline
```

## Required Skill Sets

### Technical Skills
```markdown
1. Operating Systems
   - Windows forensics
   - Linux forensics
   - macOS forensics

2. File Systems
   - NTFS
   - FAT32
   - ext4
   - HFS+/APFS

3. Tools Proficiency
   - Autopsy
   - FTK
   - EnCase
   - Volatility
```

### Soft Skills
```markdown
1. Documentation
   - Report writing
   - Evidence logging
   - Chain of custody

2. Communication
   - Technical explanation
   - Court testimony
   - Stakeholder updates
```

## Evidence Handling

### Collection Process
```markdown
1. Initial Response
   - Document scene
   - Photograph evidence
   - Note system state

2. Preservation
   - Create disk images
   - Calculate hashes
   - Secure storage
```

### Analysis Workflow
```markdown
1. Data Recovery
   - Carve deleted files
   - Extract artifacts
   - Timeline creation

2. Documentation
   - Progress notes
   - Findings log
   - Final report
```

## Preliminary Case Review

### Initial Steps
```markdown
1. Case Information
   - Incident type
   - Time/date
   - Location
   - Evidence list

2. Stakeholder Requirements
   - Investigation scope
   - Priority items
   - Timeline needs
```

## Autopsy Practical Guide

### Evidence Preservation
```markdown
1. Create New Case
   - Case name
   - Base directory
   - Case number

2. Add Data Source
   - Select source type
   - Configure image
   - Run ingest modules
```

### Analysis Features
```markdown
1. File Analysis
   - Timeline view
   - Keyword search
   - File category view
   - Hash lookup

2. Results
   - Bookmark items
   - Generate reports
   - Export artifacts
```

## Example Case Workflow

### Initial Setup
```plaintext
1. Create Case Directory
   /Cases/
   └── Case001/
       ├── Evidence/
       ├── Documentation/
       └── Reports/

2. Document System State
   - Power status
   - Network connections
   - Running processes
```

### Evidence Collection
```plaintext
1. Create Forensic Image
   # Using FTK Imager
   - Select source drive
   - Configure destination
   - Verify hash values

2. Analysis Setup
   # Using Autopsy
   - Create new case
   - Add evidence source
   - Configure ingest modules
```

## Best Practices

### Documentation
```markdown
1. Case Notes
   - Every action taken
   - Timestamps
   - Tool versions
   - Findings

2. Evidence Handling
   - Chain of custody forms
   - Storage locations
   - Transfer records
```

### Report Writing
```markdown
1. Structure
   - Executive summary
   - Methodology
   - Findings
   - Conclusions

2. Attachments
   - Evidence photos
   - Timeline data
   - Tool outputs
   - Chain of custody
```
