Yes — there **are Docker containers available** for setting up a **Forensics Lab**, and they can be quite lightweight and modular. Depending on your goal (memory forensics, disk analysis, network forensics, etc.), here are some great options:

---

### 🔍 1. **[SIFT Workstation](https://github.com/teamdfir/sift-cli)** (by SANS)
- **Purpose**: Full digital forensics and incident response toolkit.
- **Docker?** Yes, but best via Ubuntu + Docker or full VM.
- **Tools included**: Autopsy, Volatility, Sleuth Kit, Plaso, etc.

🛠️ Run with:
```bash
docker pull teamdfir/sift
```
> ⚠️ Note: Some tools need GUI or heavy resources, so this is often better as a VM (from SANS).

### 🧠 2. **Volatility** (Memory Forensics)
- **Purpose**: Memory dump analysis.
- **Docker?** Yes.
- **Usage**: CLI-based. Great for lightweight memory forensic work.

🛠️ Run with:
```bash
docker pull volatilityfoundation/volatility
```

---

### 🗂️ 3. **Autopsy + Sleuth Kit**
- **Purpose**: Disk image analysis.
- **Docker GUI?** Needs X11 forwarding or VNC.
- **Docker image**: You can try:
```bash
docker pull deanwilson/autopsy
```
But due to GUI requirements, VM-based installs are often smoother.

### 🐍 4. **KAPE** (by Eric Zimmerman — advanced triage tool)
- While not officially available as Docker, some have wrapped it in containers. More Windows-focused, so best on a Windows VM.

---

### 🧪 5. **DFIR Docker Lab (custom-built)**
- You can **create your own Docker-based DFIR lab** with tools like:
  - Wireshark (with GUI support)
  - tcpdump
  - tshark
  - Log2Timeline (Plaso)
  - Foremost / Scalpel
  - ExifTool

### 🧰 TL;DR — Docker Containers for Forensics

| Tool           | Docker Image                         | Use Case                     |
|----------------|--------------------------------------|------------------------------|
| Volatility     | `volatilityfoundation/volatility`    | Memory forensics             |
| SIFT           | `teamdfir/sift`                      | Full DFIR toolkit (heavy)    |
| Autopsy        | `deanwilson/autopsy`                 | Disk forensics (GUI needed)  |
| Wireshark      | `linuxserver/wireshark`              | Packet analysis (needs GUI)  |
| Plaso (Log2Timeline) | Various user builds             | Timeline generation          |
