# Understanding SIEM Logs, Analysis, and Implementation

## 1. Log Analysis and Security Event Identification

### Common Log Types and Their Security Relevance

#### Authentication Logs
```text
2025-04-19 10:23:45 auth.log: User bob failed login attempt from IP 192.168.1.100
```
- Identifies: Failed login attempts, brute force attacks, unauthorized access attempts
- Key fields: Timestamp, username, IP address, success/failure status

#### Firewall Logs
```text
2025-04-19 10:25:12 firewall.log: DENY TCP 203.0.113.100:45678 -> 192.168.1.10:3389
```
- Identifies: Port scans, unauthorized access attempts, suspicious connections
- Key fields: Source IP, destination IP, ports, action (allow/deny)

#### Web Server Logs
```text
192.168.1.50 - - [19/Apr/2025:10:30:15 +0000] "GET /admin.php HTTP/1.1" 404 287
```
- Identifies: Web attacks, directory traversal, suspicious requests
- Key fields: Client IP, timestamp, request method, URL path, response code

## 2. Field Correlation Across Log Files

### Example of Cross-Log Correlation
```text
# Authentication Log
2025-04-19 10:45:00 auth.log: User admin successful login from 192.168.1.50

# File Access Log
2025-04-19 10:45:30 access.log: User admin accessed sensitive_file.txt

# Network Log
2025-04-19 10:46:00 network.log: Large data transfer from 192.168.1.50 to 203.0.113.100
```

### Key Fields for Correlation
- Timestamps
- IP addresses
- Usernames
- Session IDs
- Resource names

## 3. Designing Correlation Rules

### Example Rule: Potential Data Exfiltration
```yaml
Rule Name: Data_Exfiltration_Alert
Conditions:
  - Successful authentication from internal IP
  - Access to sensitive file within 5 minutes
  - Large outbound transfer (>10MB) within 5 minutes
  - Destination IP not in whitelist
Actions:
  - Generate high-priority alert
  - Send email to Security team
  - Block source IP temporarily
```

### Example Rule: Brute Force Detection
```yaml
Rule Name: Brute_Force_Detection
Conditions:
  - More than 5 failed login attempts
  - Same username
  - Within 5-minute window
  - From same source IP
Actions:
  - Generate medium-priority alert
  - Add source IP to blocklist
  - Send SMS to IT admin
```

## 4. Selecting a SIEM Vendor

### Key Considerations

#### Organization Size and Budget
- Small (<100 employees): Wazuh, Security Onion
- Medium (100-1000): Splunk Cloud, ELK Stack
- Enterprise (1000+): IBM QRadar, Exabeam

#### Feature Requirements Checklist
- [ ] Log ingestion capacity
- [ ] Retention period
- [ ] Real-time monitoring
- [ ] Custom rule creation
- [ ] Integration capabilities
- [ ] Compliance reporting
- [ ] Cost per GB ingested

#### Comparison Example
| Feature | Splunk | ELK Stack | QRadar |
|---------|--------|------------|---------|
| Deployment | Cloud/On-prem | On-prem/Cloud | On-prem |
| Pricing | Per GB | Open Source* | Per EPS |
| Learning Curve | Moderate | Steep | Moderate |
| Community Support | Excellent | Strong | Limited |

### Implementation Considerations
1. Data volume analysis
2. Required skill set
3. Integration requirements
4. Compliance needs
5. Support requirements
6. Total cost of ownership

## Best Practices
- Start with critical logs only
- Define clear use cases
- Document correlation rules
- Regular rule tuning
- Establish baseline metrics
- Plan for scalability

This guide provides a foundation for understanding SIEM implementation and management. Adjust these examples and considerations based on your specific organizational needs and security requirements.
